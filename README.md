Quiz Management System

A Java-based Quiz Management System designed to allow students to take quizzes with two types of questions: True/False and Multiple Choice. The system consists of 10 classes that handle the quiz process, from presenting questions to calculating and displaying results.

Features:
- Handles True/False and Multiple Choice questions
- Allows students to take quizzes and receive immediate results
- Simple structure focusing on quiz functionality

Note: This project currently focuses on the core quiz-taking and result-calculating functionality without a graphical user interface.
